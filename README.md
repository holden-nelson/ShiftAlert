# Shift Alert

Shift Alert is an integration for Lightspeed POS.

It allows you to give your employees access to their timecard without giving them access to the rest of your reports.

This is a very basic Django app that is currently hosted at [shiftalert.co](https://shiftalert.co). If you're finding this repo and wanting to use the software, feel free to sign up for an account and help me test it out.
